# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

Include the thread URL so future iterations can use the `read_thread` tool to reference previous work if needed.

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**
- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Testing Requirements (Critical)

**Every story MUST include tests that verify its acceptance criteria.**

### For Feature Stories:
1. **Write unit tests** that verify the specific functionality in acceptance criteria
2. Tests go in the appropriate test directory following project conventions
3. Use the project's existing test framework
4. Run `npm test` (or equivalent) before committing

### For Integration Tests Story (Final Story):
1. Write integration/functional tests covering complete user flows
2. Test end-to-end scenarios from the original PRD
3. Verify all previous unit tests still pass
4. Tests should cover data persistence, component interaction, and error handling

### Test Verification Order:
1. Write the implementation code
2. Write unit tests for the acceptance criteria
3. Run typecheck - must pass
4. Run all tests - must pass
5. Only then commit the changes

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)

For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser using Selenium MCP tools:

1. Start a browser session: `mcp__selenium__start_browser` (chrome or firefox)
2. Navigate to the relevant page: `mcp__selenium__navigate`
3. Find and interact with elements: `mcp__selenium__find_element`, `mcp__selenium__click_element`, `mcp__selenium__send_keys`
4. Verify UI changes work as expected: `mcp__selenium__get_element_text`
5. Take a screenshot if helpful: `mcp__selenium__take_screenshot`
6. Close the session when done: `mcp__selenium__close_session`

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
