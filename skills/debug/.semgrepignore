# Semgrep ignore file for debug skill

# SessionManager.ts path traversal warnings are false positives:
# - baseDir is validated in constructor (null byte check, path.resolve normalization)
# - sessionId is validated with strict regex pattern in validateSessionId()
# - getSessionPath() performs additional boundary checks
# These warnings are acknowledged as false positives
